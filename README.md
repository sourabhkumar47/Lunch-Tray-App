Lunch Tray App
==================================

Introduction
------------

* In this project, we'll leverage the skills to build out
a lunch ordering app called **Lunch Tray**, 
* implementing :- 
view model,
data binding,
and navigation between screens.

* Navigation is a fundamental part of Android development. Whether we're using 
an app to browse recipes, find directions to your favorite restaurant, or most 
importantly, order food, chances are that you're navigating multiple screens of 
content.
